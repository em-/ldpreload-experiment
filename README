SleepLess
=========
This is a simple demonstration of how LD_PRELOAD works.

test.c calls the test_sleep() function in libtest.c which, in turn,
calls the print_sleep() function in the same library and the sleep()
function from the C library.

libsleepless.c shows how to intercept the calls done in the library, 
invoking then the original function or doing nothing.

Just run 'make' to see how it works.


The code is based on the presentation given by Gilad Ben-Yossef and
available at http://benyossef.com/, and is released to the public
domain so you are free to do whatever you want with it.
